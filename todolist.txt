Priority changes

    Naming format for Vertices, require the location tag (B1L1 etc) in the format to prevent conflict in lookup
    Heading change function
    Quit option for all selections, return to previous selection state
    For add_existing_neighoburs, remove the option to select itself and options already in dictionary


Good to do but not urgent
    Existing vertex selection for query vertex
    For new vertices, add context that you can add existing vertices as neighbours in the modification tool later
