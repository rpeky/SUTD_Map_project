Priority changes

    Quit option for all selections, return to previous selection state - WIP peky
    Add lookup for point using room ID - for user to select - WIP peky
    Auto update distance and heading of 3rd vertex based on connection to two existing vertices (trigo) - WIP cy
    Append dictionary attribute info - WIP cy
    jsonprocessing.py/graph.py/lookup_locationid - validate by combing through and rebuilding the lookup based on master data [room_id] values


Good to do but not urgent
    Existing vertex selection for query vertex
    For new vertices, add context that you can add existing vertices as neighbours in the modification tool later
    Shift pathfinding functions from Graph.py to Path_query.py
